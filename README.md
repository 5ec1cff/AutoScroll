==========

For users on Linux or Mac, the lack of autoscroll can be a big pain. This extension can help!

====================================

* AutoScroll does not scroll on `contenteditable` elements; Firefox does

TODO

* Use SVG rather than PNG images
* Use the nice Radiance and Ambiance images provided by a user
* Disable autoscrolling on Windows (since it has native autoscrolling already) ?
* Add better scaling (slower when near the disc, faster when away from the disc, like in Firefox)
* Add configurable scaling
* Move speed should be 0 = slowest, 10 = fastest
* Use a slider for the move speed, rather than a number box
* Fix the severe bug with pinch-to-zoom on Mac
* Add better promotional images on the Chrome Web Store
* Add in an option for reversing the X and Y axis (up is down, down is up, etc.)
* Add in touchscreen/tablet support
* When scrolling horizontally, it should only scroll when the mouse is to the left/right of the disc, like in Firefox
* When scrolling vertically, it should only scroll when the mouse is to the top/bottom of the disc, like in Firefox
* Add in an option to stop autoscrolling when the user scrolls with the mouse wheel
* Option for keyboard-only control
* Option to change the key binding for activating AutoScroll
* Switch to the new options page system (in Chrome)
